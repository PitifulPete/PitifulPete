#### There are so many interesting things to tell you, but let's start from here:
- i'm a Technical Writer --- and i absolutely love everything about the profession 
- i don't just exist in this space, i exist with the conviction that documentation (and extensively, content) is fundamental to the success of any user-involving exercise.
- i'm open to contributing to interesting things and working on exciting projects.

#### Now let's take a break.
